The Client agrees to provide the Contractor with the necessary instructions and passwords to allow it to obtain remote access to the Client’s systems as the Contractor reasonably requires for the purposes of performing the Implementation Services hereunder. The Client further acknowledges that the Services do not include the provision of ongoing service or support for the Deliverables beyond the stated bug support period, and the Client will be responsible for their regular upkeep and functioning.<br/>
                            Upon publishing the project live, the Client will receive one (1) month of bug support, limited to correcting errors, defects, non-conformities, or issues that are directly related to the original scope of work. Any additional fixes or enhancements beyond this period, or any bug, defect, non-conformity, or issue that was not reported by the Client during the Implementation Phase or within this one (1) month period, will be deemed accepted by the Client and considered outside the agreed scope, requiring a separate estimate and approval before work begins. The Contractor makes no guarantee of any specific commercial success or business results arising from the Implementation Deliverables, and any performance tuning, scalability enhancements, or optimizations shall be considered additional services subject to a separate agreement and fees. The Client shall be solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining any third-party subscriptions, licenses, or tools necessary for the Implementation Deliverables to function as intended, including payment of any associated costs. In any event, the Contractor’s total liability for any claims arising from the Implementation Services shall not exceed the total Fees paid by the Client specifically for the Implementation portion of this Agreement.<br/>The Client acknowledges that any timelines or schedules provided by the Contractor for the Implementation Services are good-faith estimates based on the information available at the time. The Contractor shall not be liable for delays caused by factors beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to third-party dependencies, changes in scope, or the Client’s failure to provide timely approvals, information, or materials. The Contractor will use commercially reasonable efforts to meet all estimated deadlines but does not guarantee exact completion dates, and the Client agrees that any such delay shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement nor give rise to any liability for losses or damages.

In the event the Contractor is required to incur any expenses in performance of the Services, the Contractor shall notify the Client in advance of any such expenses and, upon approval from the Client, shall invoice such expenses alongside the other amounts due and payable pursuant to this Agreement.
